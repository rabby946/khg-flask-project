KHG Membership & Loan Management System
💡 Overview

The KHG Membership & Loan Management System is a web-based platform designed for Korje Hasanah Group (KHG) — a non-profit organisation providing interest-free microloans to its members.
The system manages membership, donations, loan applications, repayments, fund tracking, and admin operations in a secure and structured way.

Developed using Flask (Python), this project streamlines KHG’s financial and membership activities with real-time data management, Cloudinary-based media storage, and PostgreSQL for robust persistence.
